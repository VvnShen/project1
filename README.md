# PROJET 1 : A COVID-19 THEME ETF

## Introduction

This project aims to create an ETF for covid vaccination companies, based on a “vaccination company index” that we will create. The goal is to use this index to compare the performance of vaccination companies to the performance of the biotechnology industry and the general market. Because we consider the Covid-19 pandemic a markt changing event, we will look back at the pre-covid years and the performance during covid. 

## Question 1: Which companies compose the etf?

Initially, we follow a list of COVID vaccines developers. We looked at the backgrond of each of the companies and selected 10 companies. The companies that are filtered out are companies that are either not publicly traded at least 1 year before the pandemic started (so we can have enough data), state companies, and private companies. Finally the following 10 companies are selected:

Moderna (MRNA)			$1.73 B
Inovio (INO)				$1.69B
Pfizer (PFE)				$246.36B
AstraZeneca (AZN)			$187.99B
Novavax (NVAX)			$18.48B
Medicago (MDGS)			$1.41B
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)		$432.67B
Merck (MRK)				$186.33B
Sanofi (SNY)				$120.86B
GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK)	$96.58B	



## Question 2: What should be the weight of each company in the ETF?

## Question 3: How will our ETF perform comparing to a benchmark index?
